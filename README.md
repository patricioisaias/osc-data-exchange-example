# OSC Data Exchange Template

This OSC Data Exchange Template demonstrates how to seamlessly exchange data between [Processing](https://processing.org/) and [Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max) using the [Open Sound Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_Control) protocol. This template serves as a perfect starting point for audiovisual projects, enabling interactive and dynamic data exchange between the two platforms.
